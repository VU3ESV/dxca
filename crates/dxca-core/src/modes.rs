/// comments with no mode field at all. Before this, such a spot reached
/// `canonical("")` and was bucketed as **DATA** — an unmarked guess that
/// credited phone spots to digital award slots. An empty return means the
/// frequency was in no segment worth guessing about, and callers must treat
/// that as *unknown*, not as DATA.
/// WSJT-X reports a decode's mode as the **single character** it prints in
/// its own decode window, not as a mode name: `~` is FT8, `+` is FT4, and so
/// on. Passing that through unmapped puts a `~` in the mode column and makes
/// a locally decoded spot look like it has no mode at all — which is exactly
/// how it was reported from a Windows install running WSJT-X.
///
/// Only the characters worth being sure about are mapped. Anything else
/// returns `None`, so the caller can fall back to the Status message's own
/// mode string, which is a proper name and authoritative.
